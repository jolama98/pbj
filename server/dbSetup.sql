A prince with words both sweet and kind,
Met a princess, her heart so bright,
Their bond grew strong beneath the night.

The prince, with every gentle phrase,
Set her heart and soul ablaze.
She loved the way he spoke so true,
And all the things he dared to do.

But there was one, a knight so bold,
With eyes that watched, a heart of gold.
He guarded her with fierce intent,
A bond that neither could repent.

Each night he waited, filled with dread,
While thoughts of her and the prince were spread.
For though he loved her as a friend,
He feared the prince would be her end.

The princess, torn in heart and mind,
With love for both, she felt confined.
She did not wish to see them fight,
Nor lose her bond with her loyal knight.

But in the dark, beneath the sky,
She met the prince, though nights slipped by.
She cherished all he had to say,
But feared what would come, come the day.

For friendship, love, and duty bind,
A tangled web thatâ€™s hard to find,
Yet in her heart, she wished to be,
Free with them both, in harmony.
